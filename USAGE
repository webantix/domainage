domainage.py Usage Instructions

domainage will search through DNS names to look for newly registered
entries. Newly registered is defined as <1 year old. These may be
indicative of malicious sites.

-d $DNSname
This is "interactive" usage. You pass it a single DNS name and
domainage.py will process it.

-f $filename
This will process a file with a list of domains, one domain per line.
For example: I want to process logs from bro this way. I'll decompress
them, use bro-cut to only output the DNS query, get rid of some I
don't care about, and finally deduplicate the output:
zcat /nsm/bro/logs/2017-05-06/dns.* | bro-cut -d query | grep -vi -e
\x00 -e \.local$ -e \.arpa$ | sort -u > dns.log
./domainage.py -f dns.log

-b $brolog
This option takes a dns.log file from bro and processes each domain.
For example:
zcat /nsm/bro/logs/2017-05-06/dns.22\:00\:00-23\:00\:00.log.gz > bro-dns.log
./domainage.py -b bro-dns.log
